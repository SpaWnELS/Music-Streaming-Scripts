# Music-Streaming-Scripts

## What is this?

Finding a satisfactory free music streaming solution can be a challenging quest in today's digital age.
While the world of music streaming offers convenience and a vast library of tunes, it also comes at a cost,
both financially and in terms of compatibility across time and devices.

These few scripts aim to provide a solution to this problem. By making use of different APIs, they allow for
the automatic download of newly liked songs on YouTube Music, as well as the seamless synchronisation of
all liked songs between YouTube Music and Spotify.
